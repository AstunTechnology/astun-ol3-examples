# OpenLayers Examples using ADS and iShare services

A collection of examples showing how [Astun Technology](http://astuntechnology.com/) services can be used with the [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org/) client-side mapping library. To view simply clone the repo or download the zip and open each of the html files in a web browser.

You can also view the example thanks to rawgithub.com here:

* [ADS OS Open WMS](http://rawgithub.com/AstunTechnology/astun-ol3-examples/master/ads/ads_wms.html)
* [iShare GeoJSON](http://rawgithub.com/AstunTechnology/astun-ol3-examples/master/ishare/ishare_geojson.html)
* [iShare LiteMap](http://rawgithub.com/AstunTechnology/astun-ol3-examples/master/ishare/ishare_lite.html)

Note: You may find that the above links do not work over `https` as they load
content from plain `http` sources. Try updating the URL in your browser to
`http://` if you have trouble.
